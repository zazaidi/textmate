#Sister
Just spent past couple hours watching videos on hangout with sister and Ammi. It was nice talking and spending time with her and I miss her a lot. I hope we can be more constant in our connection..

Just came to Gold bar to work on my research.
#Write
I need to write and express my thoughts for the thirty minutes that I am here. 

Research
---

Why am I feeling so unmotivated with working on my research? Where is the passion and the fire? When one works on something they love they can't wait to work on it the moment they are free. But for me I get this uneasy feeling and really have to forec myself to work on it. I think it is because I don't believe in myself. Kindle the fire within and let the water sprout. One has to let oneself go and have no inhibitions or filters when you write. The thoughts flow as they come and unhindered they must be allowed to speak for creativity is the real voice from within. If one traps it within the quagmire of thoughts then it loses its genuineness and becomes just another flittering cumbersome thought. This world has enough thoughts and needs more genuine ideas and sincerity. 

What can I do to motivate myself to become motivated and enthusiastic about my research? Why is my research important? 
Do you remember the original purpose of you getting into Materials Science? It was so that I may become a useful asset for the Imam (as) and I gain a valuable gift that I can help the Ummah with. Indeed the world is but a fleeting moment. In coffee shops the greatest revolutions of the mind and heart happen. I have twenty five minutes left to find myself. Who knows what will happen to me the next moment?
> The world is like *seawater* the more you drink it, the thirstier you become.

These are the immaculate words of the infallible. 
When will you realize that they're words are reality while your thoughts are a figment of falsehood and imagination? It is when you realize the world is actually a reflection of the Qur'an and the words of the Infallibles that you will truly begin to see things the way they are.
To awaken is to live every moment as if it is eternity and wait not for the next moment. 

One must fill oneself with the remembrance of Allah.

Removal of veils is what I seek. Every moment is a tool and knife and a sword to slay the self and tear the veils away. The goal of this life is see your Lord. 
> The one who knows himself will know their Lord

To know the self and to its weakness. One must realize both the potential ascension and the potential fall that exist within the Self. You must strengthen your intellect and give it command over the kingdom of the Self. Know the Truth and Haq through it. Know that the only reality that exists is Allah and all else is a reflection of Him. 

How can one prove the existence of the Lord?
---

It is by true and sincere reflection. When one clears the cobwebs and the conditioning that has been done to the mind and thinks when one is in a serene and peaceful moment: At one moment I did not exist and then I came into being. Who is it that brought me out of non-existence and into existence? Nature made the means necessary for my existence to come about - but I went from a material clot into a conscious human being. And day by day I grew and I grew, growing in strength and intellgience. Can all the humans come together and create anything that can grow in intellegience and strength? Rather everything we fabricate begins to deteriorate the day after.

Once I know that there is a Lord, how do I connect with Him?
---
If you purify your thoughts and make your intention firm, you will begin to feel His presence in your life. You will begin to see things differently in the world and every thing big or small will have meaning in your life. 
> Everything in the heavens and earth is busy in the rememberance of their Lord. 

You must use the means he has given you to remember and obey Him and He will slowly purify you. The Qur'an and supplications of the Ahlulbayt are the most direct and key way of connecting with your Creator. 

_Subconciously thoughts come into my mind that begin to inflame the desires - Return to focus on the present moment to let them subside_

In this life the only thing of value is the time you spend in remembrance and invocation of your Lord. The greatest dhikr is the dhikr of action. Completely stop and turn yourself away from all that which displeases Him and turn towards that which pleases him.
