Technical Problems

1. Missing or non-unique meta desc tags
2. Missing non-unique title tag
3. Invalid HTML (W3C)
4. Canonical URL problem - if content on two URL is the same, they will flag it.  
- Have to do a rewrite from www to non-www -> Or if have content on node/1 and /home, rewrite all to one page
5. Slow loading websites | Google takes into account page load time 
6. 404 pages & non 302 redirects | Best practice to setup a 302 redirect for links that don't exist anymore & user redirected to proper content

Content Problems
---

1. Poorly written copy, duplicate page content, Keywords that are too broad | Need to make sure the sentences are properly written and have enough keywords. 
2. Written at a 7th grade level | Use more common and current words | Kept words limited to 160 words or less | Use google analytics to come up with conversion rate 
3. Have conversion points -> One requesting for more information -> Registration 
> Google conversion rates around ~4%

Keyword Research
---

1. Research non-specific non-brand keyword and see where you rank | Asu Online now second for "online degree"

Things to do
---

1. SEO Checklist modules | Gives all SEO related modules
2. Recommend: Path, pathauto, page title, global redirect, path redirect, xml site map, meta tags, meta tag nodewords - XML Site map tells engine to crawl the page
3. Register sites with Google and Bing webmaster tools, Use GA to access SEO performance to conversion points, SEMOZ and Webmaster tools for finding SEO errors
4. Keyword research - adwords keyword tool, Ubersuggest, Google trends
Ubersuggest: Scrapes google search results 
Google Trends : Compares 5 keyword combinations and see search volume for terms over time

Constant care and maintenance of keyword terms | Once a week look at Analytics and see changes in traffic 
Keyword research tools -> See what competitors are using | Ranks.nl > Free for smaller sites

Site will cookie you at first visit _Show unique landing page for first time user_
Tell a story with each page -> Use stock photography 

Worked with ASU registration to fire back a Google commerce transaction that conversion has occurred 

Can put analytics code in the play button on videos to track how many people play the video
Content should be slightly different between the CLAS site and degree search 

Tags
---

Meta Description tag : Unique to every page and this is what the search result brings up - You can incorporate keywords but don't go overboard

Plan
---

Need to develop a strategic SEO plan for all university websites that should be systematically applied.
