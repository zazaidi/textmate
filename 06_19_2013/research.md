#101029z, 101030z, 101023z2 - Temperature
It is well known from previous studies that as the growth temperature is increased, the amount of indium incorporated decreases. One of the main reasons for this occurring is due to the increased mobility of the indium atoms and the inherent strain that acts as a driving force for desorption. The InGaN nanorings in our case were grown at temperatures from 570 C up to 950 C which resulted in a wide range of compositions and structures. In the case of the 570 C, the InGa droplets remained as such and very little nitrogen was able to crack the surface and absorb resulting in mainly an amorphous InGa droplets. Around this temperature, Ammonia is only expected to result in about 4% cracking efficiency which is not nearly sufficient to result in the formation of crystallized rings. As the temperature increased to 670 C, cracking efficiency of NH3 is increased and significant indium incorporation occurs resulting in the crystallization of the droplets into ring-shaped structures with nominal indium content of 68% according to EDX results. XRD shows a single strong peak indicating that phase separation is being suppressed in this sample. Morphologically the rings are hexagonal in shape corresponding to the wurtzite structure of InGaN with a well defined hole in the center. One possible explanation for the formation of the hole is as the nitrogen enters into the droplet, the liquid alloy begins to flow from the center to accomodate the increased strain resulting in a relaxed structure. This relaxation mechanism allows for much higher amount of indium incorporation and increases the luminescence of the rings. PL results show that the rings emit at wavelength of 530nm as well as CL images showing the emission of green-yellow light. As the temperature is further increased to 770 C, the nanorings become more crystalline in nature but as expected the indium incorporation reduces slight phase separation begins to occur. The nanorings have a similar structure in the previous case with a hole in the center with a hexagonal shape. The indium content in these rings are 44% according to EDX which is higher than other reported structures indicating that the relaxed ring structure is improving the indium incorporation. As the temperature is further increased to 880 C, the InN and GaN peaks become very well defined in the XRD indicating phase separation is occurring, but the InGaN peak shows it has good crystallinity but it has FWHM similar to the 670 C. The 770 C sample however still has a smaller FWHM and much sharper peak than either, showing that even with higher amount of indium present the sample is more crystalline when phase separation is suppressed. The morphology of the ring at 880 C changes drastically from the previous two with the ring being formed of smaller facets at different directions and appears to be more rose-like in structure with more gaps present between the facets as compared with the more homogeneous nature of the rings grown at lower temperature. Indium because of its higher surface mobility and its increased desorption rate at this temperature, is likely to be escaping from the ring at a higher rate than the material is able to flow to fill the gaps resulting in the rose like structure. 

#110324z, 101023z2, 110322z, 110610z, 110621z - TMIn flow rate
All subsequent growths were done using growth conditions of 880 C, 200 sccm of TMIn, and 10 sccm of TMGa. 
The indium flow rate was then varied to observe the effects it would have on both the morphology of the rings and the amount of indium incorporation. At the lowest flow rate of 150 sccm there was almost a 60% drop in amount of indium in the structures with only 8% and rings in these samples did not form, rather hexagonal rose-like structures formed with no visible hole present. At 200 sccm, the structures are formed into rings with a defined hole in the center and the indium content increases to 23%. Subsequently when 230 sccm is used similar rose-like structures are formed with the absence of the hole in the center resulting in only 7% indium.  Further increasing the indium flow rate to 250 sccm results once more in the formation of rings and the amount of indium present increases to 42%. When the flow rate is finally increased to a maximum 300 sccm, nothing remains of the structure except small particles which form an open ring shape. Several conclusions can be drawn from these resulting structures. Firstly, when the structure forms into a ring shape the amount of indium drastically increases as compared to the structures without any hole indicating that the ring shape aids in the relaxation of the structure and subsequent increase in amount of indium incorporation. Secondly, the indium flow rate increases the rate at which indium flows from the center of the structure until at the maximum flow rate, almost all of the structure flows out leaving only the edges. Therefore the optimum flow rate for which indium is maximum occurs at 250 sccm giving the ring structure and an extremely high amount of indium. Other research groups have not been able to achieve this high amount of indium in their samples at this temperature indicating that the structure plays a significant role in indium incorporation. 


#110624z, 110420z 11023z2 - TMGa flow rate
The TMGa flow rate was varied from 10 sccm to 20 sccm. At the lowest flow rate, the indium incorporation was maximum at 23% and subsequently decreased to 13% then finally 3% at 20 sccm. The trend clearly indicates that an increased TMGa flow rate acts as an impediment to indium incorporation. This can be understood as more gallium flows at a higher rate into the In-Ga droplets, indium is being kicked out faster and is not being replaced fast enough. Interestingly as the more indium is ejected from the rings the more homogeneous and hexagonal the ring becomes. This is most likely due to the decreased strain in the lattice with the larger indium atoms less present, it allows the structure to relax more into the hexagonal structure. The XRD results reflects the changes in morphology of the rings. The more homogeneous and hexagonal they become, the more sharp the peaks and less FWHM becomes. Thus the sample grown with the highest TMGa flow rate results in the lowest amount of indium but had XRD with the highest crystallinity. As a result, to achieve higher indium in the rings it would be necessary to decrease the TMGa flow rate as much as possible while keeping it high enough to form the ring shape.

As seen in Figure 3a, the XRD results show a clear shift in the (0002) InGaN peak, which indicates that
the change in nominal source rates is being successfully reflected in the indium content of the samples. At
the higher T of 540 C less indium is being uniformly incorporated into the film than at 480oC.

#Good paper on Indium surface segregation http://www.cmu.edu/physics/stm/publ/35/ingan2.pdf

XPS results indicate that in general the samples which showed 40+% indium throughout the bulk in the surface, shows only about 15% on the surface whereas the sample with only 23% indium in the bulk shows about 21% in the surface. Given that there is a nucleation layer, the absolute percentage values do not give much meaning, but the relative percentages can lead further support another conclusion. In the lower temperature samples, more indium is being incorporated within the rings and thus within the bulk of the rings where as in the higher temperature sample it indicates more indium is being kicked out of the rings and coming to the surface thereby reducing the bulk indium and increasing the surface indium content which is in line with XPS results.
