Indeed the time has come for me to write. The pen is to express the depeest and most inner secrets of the self and of the universe. Why can every moment not be one of exterme ecstasy and joy and unfathomable in its peace and serenity. One cannot wait to acehive peace and happiness even a day late.* 01:01:00
