786. Today is the beginning of a new day. One must understand that this day is going to come only once in this existence. 
#Life
My life can only mean one thing and that is to be a servant of God.

It is in this respect that we can come together as one. The human being must witness oneself and submit to the current state of reality - whether is the inclination or desires to transgress beyond the prescribed limits or the prevalent fear that quivers within the bones of every person - all must be accepted and submitted. Right now feelings of desire are running through the body wanting to go beyond the limits but the conscious focus upon them should be enough to freeze them in place. The self is a kingdom that requires the rulership of an omniscient king that is aware of every vulnerability present within the fortress. The enemy is one that has thousands of years of experience in acting as a trojan and destroying all within.
