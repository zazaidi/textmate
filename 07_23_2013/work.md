Just in case it's not clear.. We have two methods now for the checkout process: RTPN & Redirect URL.

RTPN -> When a user goes through the checkout process and wants to go make the payment, a new window will open where they will complete their payment using Nelnet. Once they are complete, they will close the window and then can view their orders via the link at the bottom.

Redirect Url -> When the user wants to make the payment, he will go to the Nelnet payment page in the same window and when he finishes the payment, he will automatically be redirected to the successful payment page that will give him a direct link to the order he just made. 


SEO Strategy

XML Sitemap -> Can give priority to pages
Page Title -> Creating custom titles
Global Redirect -> Need to create automatic redirect for pages to avoid duplication 
Meta Tags -> Can set separate sections in node as your title or description
Redirect module -> Manage any redirects on pages 
Path Auto -> Will auto rename your paths
Page Title -> Page titles need to be unique
Search 404 - to redirect people to right pages instead of page not found page
