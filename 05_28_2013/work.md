SLS Menu Work
===
Need to develop an alternative solution for http://sls.asu.edu menu for mobile. 
The parent links should not be clicking but open the sub-menu allow for clicking. 
Possible solutions
> Create a mobile theme 
> Use some JS to fix the clicking issue
> Use a different kind of Drupal menu that is responsive* 13:39:47

Finished setting up my work environment to have hourly reminders. 
* 13:41:27
It is a good reminder every hour to update these files. 
Now going to investigate the sls.asu.edu site and see how the menu is constructed.

Currently researching different solutions for the SLS menu problem. So far haven't found any Drupal specific solutions

Current Solutions
---

1. Create a mobile theme  
This seems unnecessary as the menu seems to be the only thing not functioning properly in the mobile environment. A menu specific solution seems to be the best option. 

2. CSS/JS Custom Solution (Time Consuming)

3. Superfish Solution  
The first link seems like a viable CSS/JS based solution. I will try modifying the CSS and adding the custom JS on the Pantheon dev site and see if this simple fix will work.

Recreate the menu using Superfish which automatically has responsive behavior in menus.
